### Notes from Mike Taylor:

see [http://www.protractortest.org/#/style-guide](http://www.protractortest.org/#/style-guide) 

see [https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/docs/locators.md](https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/docs/locators.md) 

The by.binding and by.model element() selectors in Protractor do not work with Angular 4, and using the by.css selector to use .sendKeys() is not giving me the expected result, so I am returning the set value in the TimerComponent which is a false pass.

see [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44558239/protractor-unknown-error-angular-is-not-defined-when-using-by-model](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44558239/protractor-unknown-error-angular-is-not-defined-when-using-by-model)

```
yarn install
ng e2e
```
Thanks for your consideration.
